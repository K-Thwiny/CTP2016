# Lab 5 Handout: Hashing, HashMaps, and TreeMaps

## Definitions

* [Associative Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array)
    - are a data structure for mapping keys to values, where keys can be other data types, like strings, unlike arrays which are limited to integer indexes. They can be implemented with different algorithms, either hash functions and tables or sorted trees.
    - Also known as **_maps_**, **_dictionaries_**, or **_key-value pairs_** in different programming languages.
    - In JavaScript represented with objects or JSON notation.
* [Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)
    - a data structure that maps keys to values used for implementing associative arrays. Based on hash functions which transform keys to integer indexes.

## What to know

* Know the Map interface (for your language of choice) well
* Know when to choose a HashMap vs a TreeMap
* Maps are extremely useful in solving problems efficiently
    - maintaining frequencies, fast searching, sorting data
