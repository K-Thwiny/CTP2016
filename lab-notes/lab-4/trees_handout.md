# Lab 4 Handout: Trees and Binary Search Trees

## Definitions

* [Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure))
    - A tree is a hierarchical data structure for storing information _items_ and linking between them. Items are stored in _nodes_ and each node can link to 0 or more subtrees.
    - The most common trees are _rooted trees_, although they don't have to be.
* [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)
    - A binary search tree is a rooted binary tree, that maintains linked subtrees in order.
    - A binary tree, is a tree in which nodes have _at most_ two subtrees.

### Questions to consider

* Tree Operations
    - How do you insert, find, and remove items in a tree? 
    - How do you perform _pre-order_, _in-order_, and _post-order_ traversals? 
* Unbalanced Trees
    - Can you insert data such that you produce a worst case BST?
    - How does an unbalanced tree affect tree operation runtime complexities?
    - How can you produce balanced BST?
* When are _Heaps_ useful?
