# Lab 3 Handout: Searching and Sorting Algorithms

## Definitions

* [Searching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm)
    - A search algorithm is an algorithm that _retrieves_ information stored within some data structure.
* [Sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)
    - A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that _puts_ elements of a list in a certain _order_.

### Questions to consider

* Searching Algorithms
    - What is the run-time?
    - Can I efficiently search un-sorted data?
* Sorting Algorithms
    - What is an in-place sorting algorithm?
    - What are the benefits of in-place algorithms?
    - What is a stable sorting algorithm?
    - When would I prefer a stable sorting algorithm?
