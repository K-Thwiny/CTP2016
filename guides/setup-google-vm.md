# Setup Google Compute Engine VM

We will be using Google Cloud Platform services to deploy our webpages and applications throughout the semester. Through the Google Education program, we have received $50 credits for each of you to use the rest of the semester. (_Note: You do not need a credit card to claim the credits_)

To setup your Compute Engine VM, you will have to:

1. Claim your credit (using your edu emails)
2. Create a project and link your credit for billing
3. Create SSH keys
4. Create a Compute Engine VM
    - **IMPORTANT:**  Make sure you create a Micro VM, that costs **under $5 per month**. If you create a larger VM, you will spend your credit too quickly, and wont be able to do a demo at the end of the program!
5. Verify you can login to your VM from your local machine
6. Publish your personal webpage to your new VM using the ["Static Webpage Hosting guide"](static-webpage-hosting.md)

Guides for steps 1-5 for Mac, Windows, and Linux were created by your fellow classmates (Thanks Ammad Khan, Robinson Collado, and Jean Pe√±a):
